# 📚 Notes

This folder contains my personal notes, summaries, and quick references as I learn Swift and iOS development. I’ll be adding insights from:

- Courses (like Udemy and Paul Hudson’s tutorials)
- Apple documentation
- Real-world project discoveries
- Interview prep topics

## 📌 Topics Planned

- Swift syntax & language rules
- UIKit layout & components
- SwiftUI concepts and comparisons
- Xcode tips and Git workflows
- Architecture patterns (MVC, MVVM)
- Networking, JSON, Core Data
- Async/Await and concurrency

🛠️ This is a growing collection, built as I learn. Expect it to evolve weekly!
